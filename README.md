Who Is Gillie Da Kid? Rapper Says Police Told Him 17-Year-Old Basketball Star Noah Scurry Was His Son’s Killer

Gillie is well known for his independent grind in the rap industry and his claim of ghostwriting for major artists, including Lil Wayne, though the latter has never confirmed it.

On January 14, 2025, 17-year-old Noah Scurry, a star basketball player, was shot and killed outside his home in Philadelphia. The attack took place around 7 a.m. in an alley behind Rohrer Street, with at least 20 gunshots fired.

Scurry, described as a top-performing student and athlete, had recently scored the highest SAT placement score in his school. His murder devastated the school community.

Authorities revealed that a white Jeep Cherokee was linked to the shooting, with at least two gunmen exiting the vehicle while a third individual possibly acted as the driver.

Gillie described Scurry’s killing as "divine justice." "He had to deal with God, that’s how I look at it."

Authorities have not publicly confirmed Scurry’s involvement in Spady’s death. Investigations into both murders are ongoing.

Gillie, born Nasir Fard, is a rapper and podcast host known for his work in Major Figgas and claims of ghostwriting for Lil Wayne. He co-hosts the popular Million Dollaz Worth of Game podcast and has been outspoken about gun violence in Philadelphia following his son’s death.


Rapper Gillie Da Kid reveals shocking link between his son's death and murder of basketball star Noah Scurry

Devin Spady - or YNG Cheese - was killed in a triple shooting in July 2023, with his father claiming the bullets were meant for somebody else.

Two other men were injured when the 25-year-old was shot but no arrests have been reported by the authorities. 

Spady was in the 'wrong place (at the) wrong time' and caught in the crossfire of warring blocks, his dad said.

Last month, meanwhile, 17-year-old Scurry was gunned down as he was getting into his mom's car to go to school.  

'The 17-year-old basketball player that just got shot 17 times? That's who killed my son,' Gillie Da Kid said.


'Then the police notified me and let me know that he was one of the kids that was pretty much about to get locked up for the murder, but he got murdered first.' 

The basketball star at Sameul Fels High School was killed outside his home, with around 20 shots reportedly fired in the deadly incident. 

Police last month said they had recovered a jeep that could be linked to the fatal shooting but they were still working to establish a motive.

Cops offered a $20,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction in the shooting.

'The student recently scored the highest among the Fels community on the SAT college placement tests,' school principal Melissa Rasper said.
